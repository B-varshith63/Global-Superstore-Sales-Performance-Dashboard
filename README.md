# Global-Superstore-Sales-Performance-Dashboard
This repository contains my Power BI internship project titled **“Business Performance Dashboard – Global Retail Analysis.”** It was developed using the Global Superstore dataset to visualize global retail trends, uncover insights, and identify areas for growth.

## Project Overview

The aim of this project is to create a one-page, interactive Power BI dashboard that provides a high-level view of global retail performance. It enables business leaders to explore key metrics, monitor trends, and make data-driven decisions.

## Dataset

- **Dataset Name**: Global Superstore  
- **Rows**: 51,000+  
- **Included Fields**:  
  - Order and Ship Dates  
  - Customer and Region Details  
  - Product Categories and Sub-Categories  
  - Sales, Profit, Quantity  
  - Shipping Costs

## Data Preparation

- Ensured correct data types (e.g., Date columns)
- Checked and handled missing values in key fields (Sales, Profit)
- Created a Date Table using DAX for accurate time intelligence
- Linked Date Table to main dataset on Order Date

## DAX Measures Created

- Total Sales  
- Total Profit  
- Total Orders  
- Profit Margin (%)  
- Year-over-Year (YoY) Sales

These measures power dynamic, filterable visuals and provide meaningful business context.

## Dashboard Features

- **KPI Cards**: Display Total Sales, Profit, Orders, and Profit Margin  
- **Map Visual**: Highlights Sales by Country  
- **Line Chart**: Shows Monthly Sales Trends  
- **Stacked Column Chart**: Displays Sales by Category and Sub-Category  
- **Insight Box**: Summarizes key takeaways and strategic recommendations  
- **Filters**: Year and Category slicers for interactive exploration

## Design and User Experience

- Clean and modern layout for readability
- Simplified visuals to avoid clutter
- Optimized performance by limiting visuals on a single page
- User-friendly interaction through slicers and tooltips

## Example Business Insights

- High profits from the Technology segment in the Western region indicate opportunity for targeted promotions  
- Low profit margins in the Furniture category suggest the need to review supplier pricing or operational efficiency

## Files Included

- `Business_Performance_Dashboard.pbix` – Power BI report file  
- `README.md` – Project documentation  

## Conclusion

This project showcases how Power BI can be used to transform raw data into a compelling dashboard that supports strategic business decision-making.
